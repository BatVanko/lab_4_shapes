Create classes Circle (receives radius upon initialization) and Rectangle (receives height and width upon initialization) that implement those methods (returning the result). The fields of Circle and Rectangle should be private.
Submit all the classes and your imports in the judge system

Test Code
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.calculate_area())
print(circle.calculate_perimeter())
